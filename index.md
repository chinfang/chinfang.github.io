**[Analyse local explanation using SHAP explanation model for UCI bank-marketing dataset](https://github.com/chinfang/bank-marketing)**
The project applies [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) explanation model in practice. SHAP explanation model can provide feature importance for each instance from the output of any machine learning model. In this project, I analyze useful explanations for understanding the XGBoost model from aggregating the SHAP explanations to the model and group levels with different visualisation techniques. 

**[Automatically generate Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/chinfang/auto-jupyter-notebook)**
The project automatically generate Jupyter Notebook for each OpenML dataset with corresponding information: the most important features, the machine learning model performance and dataset similarity with other 300 OpenML datasets. The dataset similarity can help user to discover other datasets with similar performance on machine learning algorithms.

**[Analyse topic evolution using Dynamic Topic Model in NIPS dataset](https://github.com/chinfang/topic-evolution)**
The goal of this project is to detect and track the change of evolution in the hot topics from
the NIPS dataset. The Dynamic Topic Model (DTM) from genism is applied to understand
how topics evolve. The difference between this model and general language topic model is,
articles are grouped by timeframe, and each timeframe’s articles arise from a set of topics
that have evolved from the last timeframe’s topics.
