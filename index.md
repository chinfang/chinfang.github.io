**[Analyse local explanation using SHAP explanation model for UCI bank-marketing dataset](https://github.com/chinfang/bank-marketing)**

This is my project using [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) explanation model in practice. SHAP explanation model provide explanation for single instance from the output of any machine learning model. In this project, I analyze useful explanations for understanding the XGBoost model from aggregating the SHAP explanations to the model and group levels with different visualisation techniques. 

**[Automatic generate Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/chinfang/auto-jupyter-notebook)**

This is my project which can automatically generate Jupyter Notebook for each OpenML dataset with corresponding information: the most important features, the machine learning model performance and dataset similarity with other 300 OpenML datasets.

**[Analyzed topic evolution using Dynamic Topic Model in NIPS dataset](https://github.com/chinfang/webretrieval/blob/master/Component_3/dtm.ipynb)**
