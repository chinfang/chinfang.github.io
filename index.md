**[Analyse local explanation using SHAP explanation model for UCI bank-marketing dataset](https://github.com/chinfang/bank-marketing)**

This is my project using [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) explanation model in practice. SHAP explanation model provide explanation for single instance from the output of any machine learning model. In this project, I analyze useful explanations for understanding the XGBoost model from aggregating the SHAP explanations to the model and group levels with different visualisation techniques.
