**[Analyse local explanation in UCI bank-marketing dataset](https://github.com/chinfang/bank-marketing)**<br/>
The goal of this project is to explore the utility of the machine learning model explanation for users. It is interesting to understand the reason why the model made the specific prediction and further help users to build trust, debug, and improve the model. We show a process for assisting evaluate the hypothesis and understanding the model from aggregating the [SHapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP)](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) explanations to the model and group levels with different visualisation techniques.  

**[Automatically generate Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/chinfang/auto-jupyter-notebook)**<br/>
The goal of this project is to automatically generate Jupyter Notebook for each OpenML dataset with corresponding information: the most important features, the machine learning model performance and dataset similarity with other 300 OpenML datasets. The dataset similarity can help user to discover other datasets with similar performance on machine learning algorithms.

**[Analyse topic evolution using Dynamic Topic Model in NIPS dataset](https://github.com/chinfang/topic-evolution)**<br/>
The goal of this project is to detect and track the change of evolution in the hot topics from
the NIPS dataset. The [Dynamic Topic Model (DTM)](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldaseqmodel.html) from genism is applied to understand
how topics evolve. The difference between this model and general language topic model is,
articles are grouped by timeframe, and each timeframe’s articles arise from a set of topics
that have evolved from the last timeframe’s topics.

**[Financial spend analysis](https://github.com/chinfang/financial-spend-analysis)**<br/>
The goal of this project is to investigate the financial expanses using graph database. We investigate the
time evolution of expenses and the competitivity between suppliers with visualisation.
